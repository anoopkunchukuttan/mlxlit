Folder structure

data:
contains 4 folders
* mono_train: Monolingual training data
	contains files with name 'lang', e.g. 'hi', 'kn' etc
* parallel_train: Parallel training data
	contains files with name 'lang1-lang2.lang1' and 'lang1-lang2.lang2', e.g. 'hi-kn.hi', 'hi-kn.kn' etc. For each language pair, there must be 2 files
* parallel_valid: Parallel Validation data
	contains files with name 'lang1-lang2.lang1' and 'lang1-lang2.lang2', e.g. 'hi-kn.hi', 'hi-kn.kn' etc. For each language pair, there must be 2 files, both of which have equal word. hi-kn.hi will have hindi words and hi-kn.kn will have kannada words
* parallel_test: Test data
	contains files with name 'lang1-lang2'. Data is in lang1, and after validation model will output it in lang2

What to do with ModelTraining.py Code to add new languages
=========================================================
Modify the 4 language lists:
	mono_langs- For monolingual data 'hi' add 'hi' in the list
	parallel_train_langs- For parallel data 'hi-kn.hi' and 'hi-kn.kn', add ('hi','kn') in the list.
	parallel_valid_langs- For parallel data 'hi-kn.hi' and 'hi-kn.kn', add ('hi','kn') in the list
	test_langs- For language pair 'hi-kn', add ('hi','kn')
	* Ordering of languages in tuple must be same as that in the filenames

These 4 correspond to above 4 folders. Languages specified in these lists must exist in the folders

Extract data to data/ folder
Add indicnlp/indic_nlp_library and indicnlp/indic_nlp_resources from
* https://github.com/anoopkunchukuttan/indic_nlp_library
* https://github.com/anoopkunchukuttan/indic_nlp_resources

Finding accuracy:
=================

Run python accuracy.py target_file_path_(typically_in_data/_folder)  predicted_file_path_(typically in outputs folder)
